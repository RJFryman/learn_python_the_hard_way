# Exercise 11. Asking Questions

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()
print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()
print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." %(
      age, height, weight)

#raw_input is a built in python function that is written to standard output
#it converts input into a string(stripping a trailing newline), and returns it.
